Wordpress Theme Starter
=======================

## Save time by using this theme starter!

At Residency Group, we do so much with Wordpress. This handly little starter kit comes pre-packaged with the necessary pieces to get your custom theme going as quick as possible. 

## What's inside? 

The 'blank' directory is the HTML5 Reset Theme by Monkey Do! Which is a great starter point to clear our browser default styling and get jQuery, Modernizer and some other useful things included right off the bat. This theme is already referenced by the 'client-child-theme', whose name you can change to whatever you'd like. 

Additionally, Wordpress is included too so you can extract it and install it on your machine. Make sure to add the themes into the wp-content/themes/ directory before expecting to see it in the Appearance settings. Also, we try to keep this repo updated with the latest version of Wordpress, but if it isn't, we're sorry! Just head to http://wordpress.org to download the most up-to-date version.
